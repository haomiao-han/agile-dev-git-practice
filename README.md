### [Swiss e-voting trial offers $150,000 in bug bounties to hackers](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18221570/swiss-e-electronic-voting-public-intrusion-test-hacking-white-hack-bug-bounties)

Debugging has always been an integral part of developing any software programs, but most of the times the responsibility of finding bugs and getting rid of them lies on the developers. Thus, it is interesting to see that the Swiss government is inviting third parties - or hackers, as the article suggests - to participate in this process. Personally I consider it to be an interesting idea: ideally bugs and vulnerabilities will be found out by the public and be rectified by the government, resulting in the "hackers" getting some extra cash and a safer e-voting system for everyone, which seems to be a win-win situation. However, there might be some concerns with this initiative as well; for example, is there a possibility that one may find bugs within the voting system and decides to not claim the "bug bounty" in order to do something more sinister afterwards? There are indeed some tricky questions that the Swiss authorities need to consider before implementing this e-voting system.

-------

The Swiss government cannot make the e-voting system completely secure by offering bug bounties, but this policy is still quite efficient. A hacker may give up the bug bounty for later crime, but it is undeniable that the bounty makes the hacker more willing to report the bug.
